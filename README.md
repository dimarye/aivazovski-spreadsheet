Live Formula Support: Calculate expressions like =SUM(1,2), =AVERAGE(A1:A3), or =RANGE(1,5) in real-time.



Rich Text Formatting: Apply bold, italic, underline, text alignment, and background color to cells.



Undo & Selection: Undo stack for actions, row/column selection, and copy-paste support (including multiline content).



Keyboard Navigation: Navigate cells using arrow keys for a seamless UX.



Custom UI: Designed with CSS Grid and Flexbox for an intuitive and modern layout.

About Me

Iâ€™m a junior developer with 8 months of programming experience, focusing on frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend with Django. This project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and building functional web applications from scratch.

Iâ€™m actively looking for frontend or full-stack opportunities (internships or junior roles). If youâ€™re hiring or have suggestions for improvement, Iâ€™d love to connect!
